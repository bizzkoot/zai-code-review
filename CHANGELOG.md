## [0.0.7] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Combined review parsing now handles real multi-chunk output syntax instead of only idealized bracketed findings
  - Plain severity banners like `## BLOCKER` and `## Minor` now establish grouping context for following findings
  - Contextual heading-style findings like `### file:line - title` and bold titles are now parsed under the active severity section
  - Narrative filler and chunk markers no longer leak into the previous finding body
- Review prompt contract hardened to reduce malformed chunk output
  - Forbids conversational introductions, praise, summaries, and sign-offs in chunk responses
  - Forbids standalone severity banners and chunk or part headings in model output
  - Instructs the model to omit findings it cannot express in the required structure instead of falling back to free-form commentary
- Added regression coverage for production-style combined chunk syntax
  - Tests now cover the noisy response shapes observed in v0.0.6 combined comments
  - Prevents future regressions where grouping passes synthetic tests but fails on real chunk output
- GitHub Action runtime migrated from Node 20 to Node 24
  - Removes the deprecation warning currently emitted by GitHub-hosted runners
  - Aligns the action metadata with the 2026 JavaScript action runtime transition
- README quickstart permissions corrected for the APIs used by the action
  - Documents `issues: write` for the summary PR comment path
  - Keeps `pull-requests: write` for PR review and inline comment behavior

## [0.0.6] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- Chunk combination now properly groups findings by severity across all chunks
  - Removed structural chunk headers (`### Chunk X/Y`) from combined review text
  - Added boundary detection in `parseFindings()` to terminate findings at chunk separators
  - Chunk headers and `---` separators no longer leak into finding content fields
- Section header parsing now captures inline content on the same line
  - `**Problem:**`, `**Impact:**`, `**Suggested fix:**`, and `**Prompt for AI Agents:**` now retain content after the colon on the same line
- SecurityCheck now reports correct line numbers using diff hunk headers (`@@`)
  - Previously counted diff headers and context lines, causing wrong line numbers
- Oversized files (>50KB patch) are now flagged with `oversized` marker and isolated into their own chunk
  - Warnings logged for oversized files to alert users of potentially incomplete reviews
- Pagination added to `filterResolvedSuggestions` to handle PRs with 100+ resolved comments
- Thread similarity threshold now validated to 0-1 range with fallback to default 0.6
- Head SHA validated early with warning if missing
- All review chunks failing now aborts with `core.setFailed` instead of posting empty review
- Low severity security findings now map to `MINOR` instead of `INFO`
  - Prevents empty sections when AI outputs content on the header line

## [0.0.5] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- Multi-chunk review summaries now preserve severity grouping across all chunks
  - Combined summary parsing now uses raw chunk output instead of post-processed text
  - Severity parsing now tolerates bullet-prefixed headings from chunk formatting
- Inline suggestion threading now replies to an existing thread at most once per run
  - Additional findings at the same file and line are posted as separate review comments
  - Prevents unrelated inline suggestions from nesting under the first matching thread

  - Example config file: `.zai-review.yaml.example`
- Configurable thread similarity threshold
  - New input: `ZAI_THREAD_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` (default: 0.6)
  - Allows tuning of thread matching sensitivity
- Outside-diff separation
  - `separateOutsideDiffComments()` identifies outside-diff markers
  - `formatOutsideDiffSection()` creates grouped collapsible sections
  - Groups comments by file for organization
  - Preserves full comment content
- Resolved comment filtering
  - `filterResolvedSuggestions()` prevents reposting resolved issues
  - Checks `comment.state === 'RESOLVED'`
  - Builds file:line key set of resolved IDs
  - Graceful fallback if API call fails

- Comprehensive integration test suite
  - Tests for custom patterns loading and YAML parsing
  - Threading integration tests with similarity matching

### Fixed
- **Wired up dead code**: `formatReview()` and `separateOutsideDiffComments()` are now called in the main flow
- Resolved comment filtering now properly integrated before posting suggestions
- CHANGELOG v0.0.1 section: removed duplicate entries

### Changed
- Security patterns refactored into configurable system
  - Built-in patterns extracted to `getBuiltInPatterns()` method
  - `checkSecurity()` now accepts optional custom patterns array
  - Invalid regex patterns in custom config are silently skipped

## [0.0.3] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- review helper modules for conversational feedback, static security checks, inline suggestions, and feedback filtering
- unit coverage for the new helper modules and inline suggestion extraction

### Fixed
- inline suggestions are now best-effort so invalid GitHub review anchors no longer fail the entire action run
- release automation now requests `contents: write` before creating releases and pushing changelog updates
- package, lockfile, changelog, and usage examples are aligned for the `v0.0.3` release

## [0.0.2] - 2026-03-19

### Changed
- fix: remove dist/ from gitignore and add to git for GitHub Actions releases
- docs: simplify README with unified workflow example

## [0.0.1] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Automatic diff chunking for large PRs that exceed API token limits
  - `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE` constant (50K characters per chunk)
  - `splitIntoChunks()` function to divide files by diff size
  - `buildChunkPrompt()` for chunk-aware prompts with progress tracking
  - Partial chunk error handling with graceful degradation

- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for automated lint, test, and build
- `AGENTS.md` for AI coding assistants and project contributors

### Changed
- **CRITICAL**: Error messages no longer expose API response data (security hardening)
- Standardized all error messages with `ERR_PREFIX` constant
- Extracted magic numbers as named constants (`PER_PAGE`, `MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`)
- Pinned `@vercel/ncc` to exact version `0.38.1`
- Removed hardcoded model validation - users can use any Z.ai model via `ZAI_MODEL` input
- Version reset from 0.3.0 to 0.0.1 (fork initialization from tarmojussila/zai-code-review)
- Repository rebranded to bizzkoot/zai-code-review
- Enhanced error messages with standardized prefix

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: API error 1261 (prompt exceeds max length) by implementing automatic chunking
- Edge case where PRs with no patchable files would fail silently

  - Now provides partial results with error messages for failed chunks

### Security
- **CRITICAL**: Error messages no longer expose API response data (prevents information disclosure)
- Retry logic for transient failure handling
